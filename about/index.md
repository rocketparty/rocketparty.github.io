I'm a Developer at Chepri.com. Ohio native. Passionate about connecting solutions to problems. Love guitars, traveling and bourbon. 

I'm a software developer by trade but at heart I'm a songwriter. I want to tell a story, I want to connect with the audience, I want to believe the software I write improves someone's life.

Currently I'm a web developer at Chepri.com. My position let's me interact directly with our clients and is without a doubt the most exciting part of the job. There's no better way to see the impact of your work than to work closely with a client. During the almost 4 years I've been at Chepri I've had the privilege of working in several roles including web development, mobile development, scrum master and occasional support specialist.

I'm growing into the philosophy that a painter doesn't specialize in colors. We all have a set of tools we use to solve problems but we shouldn't let those tools define who are. Often the most important job in any team is figuring out the right tool for the job.

Specialties: Javascript, jQuery, Ruby, PHP and Rails for web applications and RESTful APIs, Git, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite, Sencha Touch and Phonegap for mobile applications and a litany of supporting technology.
