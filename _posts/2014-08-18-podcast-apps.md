###Podcast Woes

I'll admit it, I'm a podcast addict. I listen to more podcasts than is even reasonable. I like to listen to music podcasts while I work, culture podcasts while I drive and business podcasts while I workout in the vein hopes that I will pick up a tiny nugget of wisdom while I hulk out.

Instacast has been my go to client for over a year. I haven't had any issues until this week when it started crashing and clipping programs. That was enough of a push to see if the field had changed since my last quest. (developer note: even relatively small bugs can be the only motivation a customer needs to eyeball your competition)

####Options
The world of podcast apps has seemed pretty bleak to me in the past. There's was the Apple podcast app, which is at best confusing. There's downcast, which was a buggy nightmare last time I used it (about 2 years ago). You can use Stitcher if you absolutely hate yourself and revel in laggy, confused designs.

With that playing field of ex-podcast relationships staring back at me I was excited to see that [Marco Armet](http://www.marco.org/) had cast his own podcast app out into the world.

####Vs.
There aren't a lot of things you can do with a list of items and a play button. If you're some kind of goblin you can make a skeuomorphic, reel-to-reel interface for playing episodes. Or you can just kind of show the logo and a standard play/pause button. That being said, Instacast and Overcast both have a similar layout, Overcast manages to look a little more polished.

#####Details

####Features

Overcast additionally has smart speed, playlists, voice boost (fancy eq).



####The Verdict

I still haven't pulled the trigger on the reasonably priced $4.99 upgrade, which unlocks some of the preimum features, but if the next few days go well then I think I've found my new podcast player.

If you're not completely in love with the podcast client you're currently using on your phone I would suggest giving Overcast a try. It's fast, relatively self-descriptive and attractive.
