## Touch Test	
I've gotten out to touch a few of the phones that I'm interested in purchasing. That influenced me quite a bit. 

### iPhone 6
This phone feels light. It's much nicer than the 5, a design that I have never liked. The larger screen makes sense and makes the whole phone feel more modern. They moved the power/sleep button to the side of the phone, I'm not sure how I feel about that. Overall the phone feels premium, but suggests an evolution that's converging with Android design. I think we've reached a point where all top tier phones are going to end up looking almost the same. There seems to be a market fad driving most of the design.

### Galaxy s5
This phone is pretty responsive and it's specs are impressive, but it's the ugliest of the pack. The faux leather back? Tacky and ugly. It gives the phone a weird "unwashed bar top" feel. The whole thing overall comes across as a little cheap and plastic feeling.

### HTC One
Damn this phone is tight. No seriously, this is the best designed phone on the list. It's attractive, it's the first Andriod phone I've felt that made me believe there are premium devices competing with the iPhone. Apple needs to pay attention, this ain't your fathers Android. 

This phone is is fast too. I've never used a phone that felt so ridiculously overpowered. Running tiny little apps was an insult to this phone. It's one HDMI port away from filling in as a home entertainment hub or a second laptop. This beast is a computer that can make phone calls.


## Final Thoughts

I've been an iPhone user since the first day of the 4. I'm invested in their ecosystem and have never given a lot of thought to Android. Android phones always felt second tier, the phone you get from your provider because you don't want to drop the extra scratch for a premium product. The HTC One is the first time I've felt differently. I was envious of that phone. It was sexy. My iPhone 5 looked like a thousand year old relic in comparison. I found myself wandering away from the Apple kiosk to play with the HTC One. 

I still have some reservations about tightly integrating with an OS built and maintained by an advertising company and it's ecosystem leaves me much less excited, but I'm on the fence in a way link never before. 

I might just have to flip a coin when it's time to choose.
