[Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) might be one of the most influential articles I've read. The advice may seem obvious to a lot of people, but it wasn't at all to me. 

Recasting myself as a skilled professional tasked with adding business value, rather than a person that wields code to solve problems changed my entire outlook on my professional life. 

Filed here for future reference.
