####Destruction of All Things

Well that didn't take long. I've gutted Jekyll Bootstrap/Generic site theme and replaced it with a theme built around it.

I made the transition as destructively as possible. The theme is [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/).

####Why
This theme is more streamlined and uses [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) a ruby command line interface for Jekyll that looks and works a lot more sensibly than the collection forrake files I started with.
