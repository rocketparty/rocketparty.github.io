####Getting Set Up
Github personal pages seemed like a nice alternative to hosting my own blog. I've wanted to use github as a sort of portfolio for a while and personal pages seemed like a good way to bring it all together.

I looked around to see if anyone had come up with a handy way to create entries using Markdown and turned up Jekyll. A little more poking around and I found a Jekyll blog bootstrap and some decent free templates to get me up and running.

The full set of tools I used to get up and running was

1. [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) - A better console for mac.
2. [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) - General code editing.
3. [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) - Markdown editor with previews.
4. [Github](https://github.com/) - Version control
5. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - Markdown parsing engine
6. [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap scaffold for Jekyll

To start [sign up for a github account](https://github.com/) and get set up to work on the command line. Once that's done get your personal pages account set up. You can follow git hub's own first steps instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/).

Now that you have the foundation up and running head over to [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html) and follow their easy to use Host on Github in 3 Minutes instructions. Jekyll Bootstrap is a scaffold for Jekyll that packs together a handful of useful rake tasks and a easy to use structure for a Jekyll based blog.

At this point you should have a functioning blog that doesn't look too bad. Brush up on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for creating posts and off you go.

####Post Setup Thoughts
I probably packed too much into the initial setup. I also included a gussied up template for websites that I don't completely understand. I think that likely slowed down my appreciation for the simplicity of Jekyll.

In the near future I'll probably strip out the crazy theme and make a better blog index, but for now I can start posting.
