I'm a developer that spends more time worrying about communication and business culture than he does code and design. It seems like every cluster you-know-what, every jacked deadline, every confounded feature can be brought back to an issue with communication. More precisely, they can be boiled down to either someone not being clear about what they wanted, someone not expressing their lack of understanding or someone not being able to say what they wanted. 

It seems like such an easy thing, telling another person your idea, but it's the fundamental cause of almost every issue we encounter. Why can't we jsutsayw hat we mean? 

Sometimes a communication chain is a lot more ike a fistfull of change scattered in a parking lot.
