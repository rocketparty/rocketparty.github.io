##The Accidental Creative

The accidental is a podcast by Todd Henry, a consultant and creativity maginifier. He's working in a field that I likely unfairly lump together as "self help."

The podcast is a weekly dose of inspiration. The [website for Accidental Creative](http://www.accidentalcreative.com/) is chock full of inspirational quotes of dubious value and plugs for his book. All of this is exactly the sort of thing that really turns me off. It's a bit of luck on my part that I gave the podcast enough of a chance to form an honest opinion on it. 

The Accidental Creative is good. It's generally short. It's usually a single nugget renforcing a single idea that's valuable for day-to-day interactions with other humans or for being a more effective creative. I've decided to go through and binge on the show and share a few of my favotire episodes.

###In The End
If you're engaged in creative exercises either through your jbo or your hobbies and occationally want a few motivsting or inspiring ideas, this podcast is for you. If you want the occational nugget of information that will make creating or networking easier or more productive this is likely good for you as well. Honestly, I'm usually driven crazy by things like this, but Todd manages to be both open and honest. He seems like he genuinely loves and respects the type of work he's doign and that gles a long way in my interpretation of hsi advice.
